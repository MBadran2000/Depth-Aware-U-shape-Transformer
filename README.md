# Depth-Aware-U-shape-Transformer (DAUT)
Underwater Image Enhancement using Depth Aware U-shape Transformer


The official implementation of (DAUT) depth aware U-shape transformer.


based on u-shape transformer  [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11843), [implementation](https://github.com/LintaoPeng/U-shape_Transformer_for_Underwater_Image_Enhancement)

and uses (DPT) Vision Transformers for Dense Prediction
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13413
), [implementation](https://github.com/isl-org/DPT)


below visual comparison between DAUT against U-shape Transformer and other physical and non-physical model enhancement methods, enhancing sampled images from our test dataset of different water types. it can be seen DAUT achievesÂ state-of-the-art results.
